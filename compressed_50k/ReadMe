# How to load data?

import numpy as np
variable = np.load("filename")

# example 1
compressed64 = np.load("compressed64_50k_seismic.npy")
# here, we load a npy file which contains an numpy array
# the loaded data "compressed64" have 50000 time series, each one have 64 float values.

# example 2
reconstructed64 = np.load("reconstructed_64to256_50k_seismic.npy")
# the loaded data "reconstructed64" have 50000 time series, each one have 256 float values which have been reconstructed from the "compressed64" by using inverse discrete wavelet transformation.
